            <h2 class="larger-heading">About Me</h2>
            <p class="custom-font">My name is Aaronn Mach, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer
                Science with a focus on
                Business Applications at the University of California, Riverside. <br><br>

                Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by the intersection of technology and business. My passion
                for
                understanding how technology can drive innovation and improve business processes led me to choose this
                unique and exciting academic path. At UC Riverside, I've honed my skills in software
                development and gained valuable hands-on experience through various
                coursework and extracurricular activities.<br><br>

                Outside of the classroom, I actively participate in student organizations related to technology, where I
                collaborate with like-minded individuals to explore new ideas and initiatives.
                I've also had the opportunity to intern at tech startups and conduct research, where I've applied
                my knowledge to real-world projects and gained invaluable insights into the industry. <br><br>

                Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my academic journey and explore new opportunities to apply my
                skills
                in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of technology and business. I am excited about the possibilities
                that
                lie ahead and am committed to making a positive impact through my work.<br><br>

                Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with you and
                exploring
                potential opportunities for collaboration and growth.</p>
