                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Aaronn Mach, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of
                    California, Riverside. My experience lies within both back-end and front-end development, however I
                    am
                    interested in topics such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and machine learning as
                    well.<br><br>

                    During my previous internships, I researched into fascinating topics such as LLMs (Large Language
                    Models), SEOs (Search Engine Optimization), and wafer map detection. Exploring their
                    potential applications in my daily life was extremely exciting. <br><br>

                    I'm passionate about continual growth and am actively seeking internships and opportunities to
                    expand my skill set. Don't hesitate to connect with me at amach026@ucr.edu!
